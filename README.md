## Intro to Accessibility for the Web

When we refer to a web site as being accessible, we mean that this site is available to anyone. Web site accessibility, refers to the ability of an user to interact with the web site differently from the narrow range of the "typical" user scenario, specially users with some type of impairment or disability. A site is accessible when people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it.

W3.org has a [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) that goes in-depth through a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. This accessibility guidelines ensure that users with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities can interact with the Web site just like any other user. 


WCAG is organized around four principles often called by the acronym **POUR**:

* **Perceivable**: Can users perceive the content? This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense, such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it.

* **Operable**: Can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or touch screen.

* **Understandable**: Can users understand the content? Can users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?

* **Robust**: Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents (browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?


Why Accessibility? Because it supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as:

* Older people
* People in rural areas
* People in developing countries


There is also a strong business case for accessibility. As accessibility improves overall user experience and satisfaction across multiple devices.  

**Also in many cases Web accessibility is required by law.**


[W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/) provides a great introductory video [Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SHvU2PKsM)


## Tools and Methods to browse the Web

* Screen readers (ex. ChromeVox) 
* Keyboard board, 
* Head wand and/or Mouthstick
* Magnification 
* Single switch 

These are some tool and methods users utilize to browse the web and interact with a website. 


## Semantic HTML 

Semantic HTML refers to the use of element tags with a clear meaning to the developer and browser. Some examples of semantic tags are `<form>`, `<aside>`, `<article>`, `<button>`.

Non-Semantic HTML elements, as you might have imagine, are tags that does not co-relate a meaning, like `<div>`, `<span>`


| Tag             | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `<article>`     | Defines independent, self-contained content |
| `<details>`     | Defines content aside from the page content |
| `<figcaption>`  | Defines a caption for a `<figure>` element  |
| `<figure>`      | Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, photos, etc.|
| `<footer>`      | Defines a footer for a document or section  |

[More on Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)


#### Anti Patterns

* `<div class="button" >Not a Button</div>`
* `<span class="checkbox"></span>`
* `<img src="./img/tacocat.png"/>`

#### Semantic Patterns

* `<button class="button" >A Button</button>`
* `<input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike"> <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>`
* `<img src="./img/tacocat.png" alt="A junction of a cat and a taco"/>`


## Screen Reader and Semantic HTML

As we learned above, assistive technologies are a fundamental component when building an accessible web. Here we are going to focus on screen readers and how they behave on your page. 


One popular example of screen reader is [GoogleVox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) 


### Alt Text

It specifies an alternative text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed or if the user is utilizing a screen reader. 

##### alt text and Screen readers

* An empty `alt=""` will be skipped by screen readers
* `alt="UPPERCASE"` screen reader will individually read letters.  
* Text should describe if the image contains information
* Avoid redundant text like 'This is an image'  


#### Hide elements

From Screen Readers: 
* `display: none`
* `visibility: hidden`
* `input hidden />` 

From users: 
* Approach used by Twitter

```
.screenreader{
    position: absolute; 
    left: -10000px;
    width: 1px; 
    height: 1px; 
    overflow: hidden; 
}

```

### Label and Aria Labels


[Example of Label](https://codepen.io/bruno-dasilva/pen/wvWJNRP)

 ```
  <div>
    <input type="radio" name="yoda" id="jedi" value="yoda">
    <label for="yoda">Yoda ðŸ’š</label>
    <br>
    <input type="radio" name="vader" id="vader" value="vader">
    <label for="vader">Darth Vader</label>
  </div>
 ```

 ## What is Aria? 
 
 Accessible Rich Internet Applications ([ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.


 ### Aria Labelledby

 [Example of Aria-labelledby](https://codepen.io/bruno-dasilva/pen/PozpLGQ?editors=0100)


 ```
<section id="main-section"> 
   <div id="galaxyBillingId">
        <h2>Billing Address</h2>
   </div>

   <div>
        <div id="userNameId">
            <p>Name</p>
        </div>
        <input type="text" aria-labelledby="galaxyBillingId userNameId"/>
    </div>
  <div>
    <div id="userAddressId">
      <p>Address</p>
    </div>
    <input type="text" aria-labelledby="galaxyBillingId userAddressId"/>
  </div>
  
  <div id="btn-holderId">
    <button type="text" 
            aria-labelledby="btn-holderId" 
            aria-label="Submit the form"> 
      Submit Form
    </button>
  </div>  
</section>
 ```

### Aria Role

Roles describe structures that organize content in a page. If defining a type of user interface element is not possible with HTML semantics developers must assign an ARIA role and the appropriate states and properties to an element. ARIA semantics only exposes extra information to a browser's accessibility API, and does not affect a page's DOM.

```
<article role="article"> Some content</article>
```

**Note** although it seems redundant grant role to a semantic HTML tag old browser will actually translate the code above as:

```
<div role="article"> Some content</div>
```


### Aria DescribeBy


[Example of Aria-describeBy](https://codepen.io/bruno-dasilva/pen/vYKxMdb?editors=1100)

HTML
```
<button aria-label="Close" aria-describedby="descriptionClose" 
    onclick="myDialog.close()">X</button>

<div id="descriptionClose">
Closing this window will 
 discard any information entered 
 and return you back to the main page</div>
```

CSS
```
#descriptionClose{
  position: absolute; 
    left: -10000px;
    width: 1px; 
    height: 1px; 
    overflow: hidden; 
}

```


## Colors

The color contrast between text and background is extremely important for web pages to meet basic accessibility standards. It affects some user's ability to perceive the information presented.

[The Bureau of Internet Accessibility](https://www.boia.org/blog/the-basics-and-importance-of-color-contrast-for-web-accessibility) has some really good practical advice for utilizing colors while building for the web. 

* Donâ€™t forget about navigational elements, footnote regions, menus, or any area people will see or interact with. All of these features need to be visible in order to be usable.
  
* Consider color contrast when creating brand colors and color palettes. If designers donâ€™t have accessible color combinations to work with, it will be difficult for them to deliver compliant designs.
  
* Review and test colors in the design phase before a product goes to development. This helps prevent unnecessary re-work and allows more time to make any needed revisions.


#### Technical Recommendation from WebAIM

The WebAIM guidelines recommend an AA (minimum) contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text. An exception is made for very large text (120-150% larger than the default body text), for which the ratio can go down to 3:1. Notice the difference in the contrast ratios shown below.
